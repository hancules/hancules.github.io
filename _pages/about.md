Hi there.
My name is Zhihan Cao (曹智涵), or Han for short.

I am a PhD candidate in computational linguistics at the Institute of Science Tokyo.

My main **research interest** lies in lexical semantics.
To be more specific, I am interested in to what extent and how lexico-semantic relation (e.g. antonymy, hypernymy etc.) are learned by language models and represented in text.
More broadly, I aim to explore the intersection between distributional semantics and structural semantics.

My current work mainly involves the construction of resources and metrics that enable solid analysis of lexico-semantic relation knowledge of LLMs.
I also conduct corpus analysis regarding semantic relations.
